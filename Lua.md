# The Dolphin Lua API

Dolphin features an API that allows Lua scripts to interact with the emulator.
The Lua console can be opened by going to Tools -> Open Lua Console.
The Browse... button allows you to browse your computer for a Lua script to be loaded into the console.
The Run button will begin execution of the currently loaded Lua script.
The Stop button will halt execution of the currently loaded Lua script, if it's still running.
Console -> Clear will erase the contents of the output console.
Help -> Lua Documentation will take you to the webpage for the free online book [Programming in Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html)
which is a good way to start learning how to write Lua scripts.
Help -> Dolphin Lua API will take you to this page.

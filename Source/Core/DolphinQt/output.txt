Wrote to consecutive addresses the value 0X01, 0X02, 0X03, 0X04, 0X05, 0X06, 0X07, and 0X08. Then read the base address into a ByteWrapper...
The above ByteWrapper as a u64 is 7.2623859790383e+16
The above ByteWrapper as a u32 is 16909060
The above ByteWrapper as a u16 is 258
The above ByteWrapper as a u8 is 1


5000000001 was written directly into a ByteWrapper. Now listing the value after converting it to a u64, a u32, a u16, and a u8 respectively:
5000000001
705032705
61953
1

Dolphin ships with free, unofficial DSP ROMs that can handle most games with LLE audio. These ROMs are nearly perfect, however in some scenarios they do not perform as well as the official copyrighted DSP ROMs. The offical ROMs require files to be dumped from a GameCube or Wii. Instructions for getting them can be found here: https://forums.dolphin-emu.org/Thread-howto-getting-dsp-lle-dumps
